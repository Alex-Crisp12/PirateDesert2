Sand Pirates.
Inspiration: Return of the Jedi
Inspiration: He Who Fights with Monsters (Ustai Tribe)

The priority is to make a 3D environment that the user can explore. However, forcing players to swim sucks and I don't want to make the user swim everywhere. So, put them on a sand ground. The boats themselves would be hovering over the sand, with their style more focused on aerodynamics and so domed on the tops but flat on the bottom, making the interiors simpler.

The boats can be generic boat shapes with thrusters added to make them hover?
They'll need anchors and wooden platforms to serve as docks.

Models for me to make:
Box, Banana, Beverage
Beachside cocktail? Colourful?
Perhaps a refreshment bar?
A clifftop
Prickly Pears mean cactus too.
Put a house on the boat.
Plenty of opportunities for interaction in a house.
Can even have wardrobes and things in the house but focus on pirate vibes.

Gold texture for the goblet.

The goblet has been made. The texture was mirrored.

Terrain is a thing that exists, very cool

Lemon texture for the cocktail
https://pixabay.com/vectors/lemon-fruit-food-yellow-fruit-25342/

My box will be a pizza box with pizza in it.
Needs to be higher poly. Triangular cheese?

24/03/01:
Pizza box finished (cheese wedges and a label)

Animated pizza box prefab made :)

Also invisible bounding box

24/03/08:
Importing the cocktail glass
I need to do the textures more justice.

Basic world engineering started.
Grass and dirt and such layers make the terrain object pretty
A simple fence has been set up for one edge of the bounding box
I need to get pro builder set up to build more though

24/03/15:
Let's make a simple door model.

The double door is a single maya model so that it's easier to animate.
The animator should be one the model as a whole, not the individual pieces.
Pro builder exists now.

Plan buildings ahead of making them.

The invisible wall needs to have a logical reason to exist.
A fence at the end of the jetty for example.

Maybe the water can just be a quart with no collider.

24/03/17:
Wood texture used for the jetty supports.
https://ambientcg.com/view?id=PaintedWood007B

24/03/22:
The water is several transparent quarts. It's totally actually fog.
The jetty has been moved. I need to find better fences for it.
The boat didn't have colliders and the default mesh colliders caused problems so I made do.
Here are the skyboxes I used

Cocktail animated and fixed triggers
I'm gonna use different boats instead so screw that noise.
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/sea/boats-pack-67293

24/03/26:
The different boats need jets adding to them.
To do this, I've made a model that is the right girth for adding them with relative ease.
https://ambientcg.com/view?id=Metal032
Stingray is being an unpleasant person.
Nevertheless, I have made a prefab for three of the jets on a support, letting me make hover-aerofoils.
I've also animated the two boats I've made in this manner to bob.

24/03/27:
I have adjusted the bounding box so that more of the cafeteria is accessible.
I made a prefab for the cocktail and fixed the animation to work with the prefab.
Next up, make an interior for the cafeteria.

24/03/28:
First, I need to settle on materials for the interiors.
https://ambientcg.com/view?id=Wood052
https://ambientcg.com/view?id=Tiles074

I have made space for a window and created two quads for the double glazing.
It does not reflect the player.
The interior has a floor that is separate from the outer trim (marble checker pattern)
The counter needs two different tones but I can't decide on colours until I have a ceiling and lights.
Let's put the light fittings in barrels.
The roof/ceiling is a simple red tiling because of course it is.

cactus texture (I made it green)
polyhaven.com/a/sakura_bark
The cactus model and fruit will be made by me since finding cactus models online that fit the colour scheme is hard

24/04/19:
Fruit texture (I'll make it purple)
https://ambientcg.com/view?id=Metal046B
I made the metal colour totally purple (and didn't use the metallic map cause it was too metalic)

Now I need something more woody to go on the top.
wood texture for the top of the fruit:
https://ambientcg.com/view?id=PaintedWood007C

I have drawn dots on the purple metal. It looks goofy but I'm proud of my baby.

The renders for the fruit and also the screenshot is up. I just need to do the same for the pizza (the model is finished but not the images thereof).

Rocks (for pretty stuff):

Grass added now
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/nature/grass-and-flowers-pack-1-17100

Apparently grass is images?
Like in Minecraft

Also, I used the Mixamo Standing To Crouched animation.
It didn't work
Funny though.
